# Signal_analysis


Project name : Anaylsis of EEG signal using Welch's power spectral density.

Scripting    : MATLAB scripting with machine learning

Description  :
The aim of this project is to conduct a comprehensive analysis of Electroencephalogram
(EEG) signals by employing the Welch method for Power Spectral Density (PSD)
estimation, alongside bandpass filtering techniques. This study utilizes Support Vector
Machine (SVM) classification to discern distinctive patterns within the EEG data. The
performance of the classification model is evaluated using crucial metrics such as
accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. This integrated approach of signal processing
methodologies, spectral analysis, and machine learning classification aims to provide a
robust framework for interpreting EEG signals. The ultimate goal is to offer valuable
insights into cognitive patterns or abnormalities present within EEG data, thereby
contributing to advancements in neuroscience and clinical diagnostics
 
The project demonstrated the potential of advanced signal processing techniques for early diagnosis
of neurological conditions, and our findings were well-received at the university research symposium.
